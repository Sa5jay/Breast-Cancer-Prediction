# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction

A machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer using input diagnostic data. This tool helps in early detection by analyzing key medical parameters and providing a predictive outcome.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on various medical features. It is built using Python, scikit-learn, and optionally a web front-end with Flask or Streamlit for user interaction.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ Predicts if a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**
- 📊 Uses standard datasets (e.g., Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset)
- 📈 Trained using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- 🌐 Web-based interface for easy input and results
- 💾 Model serialization using `joblib` or `pickle`

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit / Flask (for web interface)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and testing)

---

## 📝 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- **Features**: Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area, Smoothness, etc.
- **Target**: Diagnosis (B = Benign, M = Malignant)

## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Split the data into training and testing sets
3. Train various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
4. Evaluate model accuracy
5. Save the best-performing model
6. Build a front-end to accept user input and display prediction
